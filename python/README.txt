All code is original except for the keypoint processing/CNN
(Carnegie Mellon University) and some of the lines in the
bounding box function (Sameeran Rao).


The .idea directory contains the PyCharm project
settings used for our system. All the packages we
use should be specified there.


There are four main python scripts used in our system.

live_skeleton:

This is the main script that is used in our game. There are many
different functionalities that are detailed within the script.


process_keypoints:

This script takes images from the original data set and
processes them using the keypoints neural network. The 2D
points generated are then formatted into NUMPY arrays and
output as .dat files with filenames corresponding to their
labels.


skeleton_learning:

This script reads the .dat files generated by the process_keypoints
function and uses them to train specific models.


training_process:

This script reads images from the original data set and outputs
the same images but with superimposed skeletons. This script is
now longer used now that we have finished our system. This was
useful when we were first finding the best way to process our
data set to visualize our data before using it to train another
neural network.


getModels.sh:

This is a bash script that downloads information used for the 
keypoint neural network. I believe that we originally used this
to download the "hand" directory which contains the model
specifications for the keypoint neural network. If that is the
case, then it might not need to be used.
