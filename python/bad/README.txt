This folder contains the current Keras models that we have trained.
"test_model.h5" has been trained on the entire alphabet and "custom.h5"
has been trained on a specific subset of the alphabet. The other models
are trained on the range of letters specified in their names. These
models were trained using the "skeleton_learning" script found in the
main directory.
